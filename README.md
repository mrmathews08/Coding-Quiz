## Homework Assingment 4

First I created the proper files,(initially planning on CSS) and linked the ones together that neeeded to be linked. I wrote my skeleton HTML and got a good feel of the organization. Pseudocoding helped me alot through this next part as I tried to think abot step by step every element that I needed to make and what events came from those elements. 

## Installation

This project was written entirely in HTML and Javascript. It is a web application that runs through the homepage and can be activated once the 'Start Quiz' button is pressed.


## Usage 

Once the link has been clicked on, the user will be taken to a homepage where a button that says 'Start Quiz' will run a series of multiple choice questions to the user. When the 'Start Quiz' (green) button is pushed, in addition to the question appearing, a timer will begin a countdown from 76. If the user answers the prompted question correctly, then another question is prompted until 5 questions have been answered. If the user answers the question wrong, 10 seconds will be deducted to the timer. A final score is calculated after 5 questions based on the time remaining on the clock. That score is then recorded and posted on the 'High Score' page. These scores will be saved locally on the site until the user presses the 'clear scores' button (yellow), at which point the scores will be reset. There is also a return button on the highscore page that will start the quiz over at the homepage and the green 'Start Quiz' button. 




## Credits

This website was all me and some google fu. I would like to talk about some things here though. I really had some problems initiating CSS into this code. Im sure with some more time it would have become clear but I really tried focusing on the javascript portion of this. It took a little bit of trial and error with the order of the logic but it is actually really starting to come together. OPther than the CSS the only other problem I had was that my return to home button kept getting behind the other button but once I stripped it down to bare bone html and js, I was able to pipoint the issue and resolve it.
